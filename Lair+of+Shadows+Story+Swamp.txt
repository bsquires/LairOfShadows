The Swamp
The murky lowlands of our world stretch
for miles in a stinking, festering 
marshland. Filled with decaying plantlife,
insects, and the vicious creatures that
have managed to adapt to this corrosive
environment, the swamps are a dangerous place
to get lost in. The metal invaders of our 
world have managed to adapt to their
moist environment, implementing organic
material to their cold, metal exteriors.
They have found ways of taming the giant
reptiles and monsterous amphibians to travel
around the swamp.
