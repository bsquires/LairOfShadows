You are a Rogue.
You prefer stealth and dirty tricks in a 
fight that help you win, no matter what.
Though you hold no illusions of honor or
respect for your opponents, you treat each
with caution. You started off as the
village thief, picking pockets and stealing
food to survive. But you had the skills to
do what you did and still manage to escape.
This has suited your combat quite well, 
which you have started to improve after the
influx of the mysterious invaders to our
world. Focusing on small weapons that
don't weigh you down, you strike fast while
leaving no opening for the enemy to strike
back. In accordance with your policy of
staying light, your armor is not of the 
heavy variety, keeping you safe from only
glancing blows. Using your natural speed and
dexterity, you are able to get inside your 
opponents guard range and striking at their
most vulnerable places, doing the maximum
amount of damage you can in as short a time
as possible.

Your special is Agility.
This allows you to pull off feats of speed
and finess that would put to shame even the
most seasoned of our warriors.

CriticalStrike
With a snakelike movement, you slide your
weapon in between the plates of your 
opponents armor, thrusting your blade
deep into their body. As you slide away,
you twist the knife, leaving the largest 
wound you can achieve using your smaller
weapon.

Disarm
Using the techniques you developed in trying
to evade capture by our village's
peacekeepers, you target your opponent's
weapon directly. As they swing at you, you
slice at their weapon hand, and in one smooth
movement, you fling their weapon out of 
their hand using your own.
