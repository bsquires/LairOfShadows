You are a Warrior.

A natural combatant,you relish in defeating
your enemiesthrough sheer strength and
technique.
Not caring for strategy or subtlety, you
charge headfirst into combat with a
confidence that can only come from
experience. Your weapons of choice are a
sword and a shield, giving you the optimal
amount of offensive power, tempered with
a great deal of defensive potential.
As a warrior, you focus in absorbing the
damage of your foes, outlasting them in
battle. This is represented by your
naturally high constitution, granting
you the ability to take hits without
flinching and drawing a battle out to one of
attrition. You focus in heavier armor as
well, since you prefer to deflect and absorb
attacks rather than dodging. You know how
to dish out damage, but your focus on
straightforward attacking prevents you from
doing to most amount of damage as possible.

Your special skill is Focus.
This allows you to stay on target, never
losing track of your opponent. Focus is
used to implement your special abilities.

Power Strike
This potent attack channels all of your
strength into your sword arm, striking with
the entire weight of your body and then some

Block
Using your skills with a shield, you put all
of your focus into blocking the enemy's
attack. You prevent any damage to yourself
as you get into position to bash at their
armor with your sheild, allowing your
attacks to strike with more damage.
