Medusa

A snakelike fiend with a body that is too
long to be even remotely human, and with
snake-like tentacles on her head, she is
the tactical leader of the metal menace that
has invaded our world. Though she has not
been shown to engage in direct combat, she
has demonstrated that she is capable of more
destruction alone than an entire army
combined. The tentacles on her head spew
fire great distances, whereas her metal
body allows her to generate a field similar
to a lightning storm. No one has been able
to get this close to her without getting
annihilated. Destroy her before she gets the
chance to enact another of her dangerous 
plans and turns the tide for the worse in
this war.
