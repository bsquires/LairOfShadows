Canyon

A massive, jagged wound in the middle of the
desert, the canyon was formed millenia ago
by an occurance that cannot be found in
any record known to us. It reaches a depth
that cannot be measured by any method we
possess and any who have tried have not
returned. There are dangers there that have
not seen the light of day for hundreds of 
years and have adapted to their dark
environment. Be careful not to lose your 
balance, for it would be a long fall to your
doom.
