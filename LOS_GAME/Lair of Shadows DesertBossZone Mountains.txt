Mountain

The mountains stand tall within the barren
desert, looking like massive tombstones
mourning the deaths of any poor soul that
loses their way. Once upon its rocky slopes,
the land becomes more dangerous, shifting
from the flowing sands of the desert to the
jagged, razor sharp rocks.
Though the rocky ledges provide
some cover from the sands being swept up
by the strong desert winds, the mountain is
unsteady, throwing boulders down onto the
heads of any creature trying to seek refuge
in its many crevases. Here hides one of the
lieutenants of the mastermind, trying to 
extend the reach of our unearthly invaders
into our world, hoping not to be disturbed
before they are ready to push any further.
