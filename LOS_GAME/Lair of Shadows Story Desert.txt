The Desert

The world of Aether is known for its 
natural dangers, but there are few places
as known to death as the vast Deserts.
With little chance of finding water, there
is very little reason to travel here.
The desert is filled with the 
remnants of creatures that attempted to brave
its dangers. The constantly shifting dunes
uncover and recover countless bones
littered througout the entirety of the
area. However, it has been confirmed
that the metal demons are using the
desert's lack of survivable environment to
their advantage, since they don't seem to 
need water to survive.
