Lake

Within the swamp, there is a massive body of
water that is thought to be the sole provider
of all the water keeping the swamp in its
present condition. This deep lake is home
to the oldest and most terrifying creatures
that call the swamp their home. They have
evolved to develop massive tentacled bodies
with minor telepathic powers which they use
to lure in their prey and keep it from
struggling too much as they devour it
slowly.
