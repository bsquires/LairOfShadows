The Lair of Shadows

The demon's cave, this is the center of all
the misfortune that has been plaguing us
recently. The mastermind of the metal demons
has chosen this to be his domain, from
which he commands his legion. He is said
to be the most terrible of his kind, and
all the champions that we've sent to rid 
the world of him have either died, or
been turned against us. To fight him in his
cave is paramount to suicide, but it is
our only chance to be rid of his destruction
once and for all.
