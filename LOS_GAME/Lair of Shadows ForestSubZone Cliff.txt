Cliff

The forest is more trecherous than it first
appears. With acres of trees, there is no
warning for when the treeline suddenly stops,
dropping away into the ocean of Aether.
The trees themselves seem to keep the cliff
hidden, remaining thickly placed up till
the edge where they even grip the cliff
face itself. Periodically, the trees will
fall off, tearing great swaths of land with
them, shrinking the forest, bit by bit.
