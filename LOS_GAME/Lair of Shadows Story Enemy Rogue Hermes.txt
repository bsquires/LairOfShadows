Hermes

With the body of a wolf and the speed of a 
swallow, this great metallic beast takes 
great pleasure in slaughtering our forces
when they least expect it. Using devices
on its feet, it can even achieve flight, 
going over cover to attack from behind.
It prefers to attack at night, sneaking into
the hospitals and rest areas to kill those
of our soldiers who cannot fight back.
None of our soldiers sent out to hunt this
menace down ever come close to seeing more
than its outline before being cut down 
without remorse. This true demon of metal
is one of the key reasons behind the lack
of morale of our soldiers, as no one is able
to sleep knowing it could be the last time
they close their eyes. Luckily it seems to
enter a form of hibernation during the day
giving you the chance to face it on even
footing.
