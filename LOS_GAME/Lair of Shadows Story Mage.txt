You are a Mage

An intelligent fighter, you prefer to
strategize before attacking, assessing
your opponents strengths and figuring
out how best to counter them. You have
trained under the village's shaman, who
has taught you the basics of magic, turning
the world itself into your weapon. But
you decided on a different path, using your
magics to defend yourself in battle and
unload blasts of the arcane that would send
any rational being running in the other
direction. You prefer to stay as far from
your opponents as possible, raining magic
upon them before they get within striking
range. Rather than use a crude implement
of violence, you prefer your trusty
wizard staff. This allows you to channel your
power through it, striking directly with
blasts of magic, or using it as a medium to
summon your most powerful magics. Your combat
prowess at close range is greatly lessened
due to your lack of encumbering armor and
low constitution. You may be able to use
potent magic attacks, but you aren't quite as
capable as taking a hit.

Your special skill is Magic.
This raw, flowing energy allows you to pull
off feats of magic that haven't been seen
since long ago.

Fire Ball
Calling out to the fluctuating streams of
the Nether, the realm of pure magic, you 
call to you a collosal pillar of flame,
destroying anything in your path.

Heal
Imbuning yourself with magic of the land,
using it to promote wellness, a sense of
calm, and a huge burst of regeneration,
healing you if you manage to get hit.
