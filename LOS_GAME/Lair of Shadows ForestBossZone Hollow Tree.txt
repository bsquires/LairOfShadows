Hollow Tree

This tree stands at the center of the Forest.
It is the originator of the trees surrounding
it and has been on this planet longer than
any recorded civilization. It is here that
one of the lieutenants has made their base
of opperations. It is here that another
lieutenant resides. You must go there to
snuff out their attempts at building up
their army before they move in for their
fatal strike. Destroy them and rid us of
their corruption of the swamps to keep 
them from making that horrid place any worse
