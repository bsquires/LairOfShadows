Greetings! Welcome to the world of Aether.
Here, you will find adventure in every step
and danger around every corner. This world
was once a peaceful place, dangerous only
to those courageous enough to travel beyond
the boundaries of their village.
But recently, there have been some strange
tales passing between the lips of wandering
merchants. They say there are strange beings
haunting the wild places of the world.
Reports are coming in of nightly raids by
demons that gleam like swords in the
firelight. Many villages have been ransacked.
Many more are simply emptying, with no one
knowing the whereabouts of any of its
previous tenants.
Strange noises have been heard when the
lights are dim and the moon is high. Noises
like that of metal against metal, and water
striking fire.
Any glimpses of these creatures reveal
eyes that glow with unearthly light, and
weapons capable of shearing through armor
and launching fire unheardof distances.
These beings are attacking frequently and
they are moving ever closer to ridding the
world of any being that doesn't agree to
their terms.
All they ask, to spare the lives of our
people, is that we surrender our lives to
them, through slavery or indoctrination.
The others tried fighting, but they were
overwhelmed. One by one, they fell.
Now we are but a few villages, joined
together for one last push.
We cannot, we will not submit to these demons
of metal.
And so, we have chosen you, the most 
courageous amoungst our villages, and our
fiercest fighter.
You will act as our vanguard, leading the
way for the last of our soldiers to
advance to the terrible, cursed mountain:
The Lair of Shadows, for it is the 
center of all the malevolent activity, and
where the first of the demons was sighted.
It is there that the mastermind behind
this invasing must be hiding.
Go there, and purge this evil from our
world!
