Cerberus

A warrior of unparalleled skill, the only
stories we have heard of him end in the 
deaths of hundreds. With a body of midnight
colored steel, he outmatches his opponents
with the use of all three of his heads.
No one has been able to sneak up on him in
battle and no one has ever attacked him
without him reading their moves and
countering them directly. He commands the 
front line of the mastermind's forces
striking a fierce figurehead of death as 
he sweeps through the remaining forces and
holdouts that we still have defending our
front lines. Defeating him will be an
extremely difficult challange, but if it 
can be done, then it will be a morale boost
for our forces that could turn the tide of
this war.
