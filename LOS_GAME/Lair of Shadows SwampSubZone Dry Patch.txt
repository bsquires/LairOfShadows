Dry Patch

In certain parts of the swamp, there are
areas where the natural moisture of the 
environment has not affected the ground.
These patches of dry earth provide refuge
for those creatures that have not quite
adapted to their environment. Though it
seems to scare away the true demons of the
swamp, many very dangerous reptiles 
exclusively make these places their homes.
