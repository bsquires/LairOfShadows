The Forest

An area as full of danger as it is of life.
The forest is the biggest provider of
resources for our villages, but is also
among the most dangerous places on our planet.
Within the dark forest, there are creatures
that most in our village discount as the
ramblings of those crazy enough to actually
go traveling into its depths. Many who go
into the forest to collect of its bounty 
never return. The metal invaders do not have
fear of these creatures. Some of our
scouts sent in to determine the location
of the metal demons have found corpses of
creatures that have only been described
in horror stories, having been killed
by the weapons that our enemies seem to favor
